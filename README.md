This project is a classification problem. It is about whether a customer generates revenue or not. First, the problem is converted into unsupervised and then clustering algorithms like k-Modes and Hierarchical clustering are applied. After that, Categorical and Numerical Features are transformed to suit the classification algorithms. Feature Selection is done. Statistical Analysis of the independent features is done against the Target feature. Later on, classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, Bagging and Boosting models are applied and the models are compared. SMOTE is applied as the dataset is highly imbalanced. Again, the models are built after SMOTE and compared. XGBoost is found to be the most effective algorithm with an ROC AUC score of 98%.
